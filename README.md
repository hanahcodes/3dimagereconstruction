## Baseline DINOv2 + ALIKED + LightGlue for Image Matching Challenge 2025

This repository offers a baseline solution for the [Image Matching Challenge 2025](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/image-matching-challenge-2025). It combines **DINOv2** for global descriptor extraction, **ALIKED** for local feature detection and description, and **LightGlue** for efficient feature matching.

> ⚡ **Heads-up**: This isn’t the fanciest approach you’ll find—just a solid starting point to get an image matching up and running fast.

### 🚀 Usage  
**Prepare data:** Download the competition data and place it under `data/` or update the `data_dir` variable in the notebook.

**Launch notebook:** Open `baseline-dinov2-aliked-lig-070803.ipynb` in Jupyter or on Kaggle. Select a GPU accelerator.

**Configure mode:**
- `is_train = True` — evaluate locally against the training labels  
- `is_train = False` — generate a test submission

Run all cells. The script will:  
- Compute global descriptors via DINOv2  
- Detect and describe keypoints with ALIKED  
- Match features using LightGlue  
- (Optional) Import matches into a COLMAP database  
- Produce `submission.csv` in your working directory

**Submit:** Upload `submission.csv` to the Kaggle competition page.

### ⚙️ Configuration Options  
- `data_dir`: Path to competition data  
- `workdir`: Directory for intermediate files  
- `is_train`: Toggle train/eval vs. test submission  
- Matching strategy: Switch between exhaustive pairing or shortlist by global descriptors  

Feel free to tweak matching thresholds, pair selection, or swap in your favorite component.
